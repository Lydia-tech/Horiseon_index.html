Horiseon Refactor and Accessibility Challenge:
Gave the website a title Horiseon.
Changed the class to: "search-engine-optimization" from "online-reputation-management".
Changed the class to: "search-engine-optimization" from "social-media-marketing".
Removed the CSS stlying that was repeated for "online-reputation-management" and "social-media-marketing".
With the HTML h3 section, I changed class 'benefit-lead", "benefit-brand", and "benefit-cost" to class  "benefit" because each had h3, and img. Removed the CSS styling that was repeated keeping .benefit h3 and .benefit img style rules/declarations.
Added alt attribute to each image for screen reader users or if the image fails to load.
